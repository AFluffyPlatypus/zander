# zander
Zander is a Minecraft plugin that I use as an Administration tool for my Minecraft Servers.
The main goal of the Zander project is to allow me tolearn Java and the Spigot library.

## Features
#### Jukebox Radio
Enabling this will enable the /jukebox command, which will open a GUI where you can select and play any disc that is currently in the game. Personally, I have been using this with a custom resource pack and putting other music over it.
