This project is a Java starter project that I am working on. I am using project zander as a way to develop my skills in Java and to familiarise myself with the Spigot API and the library.

## Features
- Using the TitleAPI there is a nice little login message for when the user joins the server, the message also appears in the chat as well.
- When a new user joins the server for the first time, a firework will be set off and will properly welcome the user to the server with a title screen using the TitleAPI and a little message in the chat also.
